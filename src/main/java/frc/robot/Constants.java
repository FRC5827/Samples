 * <p>It is advised to statically import this class (or one of its inner classes) wherever the
 * constants are needed, to reduce verbosity.

    //In here, you will be declaring constants for things that never change
    //The two main things you will need are:
    //Xbox controller port constant: 0
    //TalonFX motor constant: (will be given soon, just leave it as 0 for now)
    //You can also have a constant for the motor input value but it is not needed (set it to 1.0 and not 9999999.0 to avoid explosions)
    //Make sure to use proper convention when making constants
